## Introduction
This program is completly based on library Ripyl

## Field case:
Communication signals are catched from oscilloscope LeCroy (in genral not important) and in order to decode the messages before and after failure, they are decoded in testing lab.
This script is just showing how to do that, with a little changes in initial library (made some changes on python generators).
