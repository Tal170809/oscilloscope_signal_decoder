## Introduction
This program is completly based on library Ripyl

## Field case:
Communication signals are catched from oscilloscope LeCroy (in genral not important) and in order to decode the messages before and after failure, they are decoded in testing lab.
This script is just showing how to do that, it means how to decode communication signals offline (away from oscilloscope).


### Remark:
For some reason, only works for Python 2.7.
